== Description ==
This is a gameboy advance game I wrote where you are a blue block and you try to attack a red block. The red block attacks you as well. 

== Running it ==
Open project1-final.gba using vba.exe. Press enter to start the game and use the arrow keys to move. Press Z to attack the red block (you have to be close) and avoid getting run over by the red block. Your health is in the top left and computer health is in the top right. 

== Source Code ==
This is one of the first C projects I ever did, so it ain't real pretty. It uses some fun data structures like linked lists and n-ary trees, and it uses DMA to load images into memory quickly. There's some fairly simple AI in the computer player to decide how aggressive to be and whether to attack to run away.
